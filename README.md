# Active Record Lite

## Description

Active Record Lite is a simplified implementation of the Object Relational Mapping pattern. It was inspired by the Rails Library Active Record. I built Active Record Lite using metaprogramming techniques in order to substitute the majority of simple SQL queries that are used to access the database on a daily basis.
